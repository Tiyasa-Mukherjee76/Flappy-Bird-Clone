# Flappy Bird Clone

A simple and fun clone of the popular **Flappy Bird** game, created using **Python** and the **Pygame** library. The objective of the game is to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without colliding into them. The game keeps track of the player's score based on how many pipes the bird successfully passes.

## Features

* **Endless gameplay**: Play until you collide with a pipe or the ground.
* **Score system**: Track your score based on how many pipes you navigate through.
* **Pipes and Bird Animation**: Dynamic pipes that move toward the player and an animated bird.
